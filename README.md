# Linear vs. non-linear embeddings for microbiomes

## An outline of the repo structure is given in the Appendix of `project_report.pdf`.
## Files with large blocks of uncommented code, such as `./post_process_embeddings/helper_functions.py` were taken from https://github.com/MaudeDavidLab/gut_microbiome_embeddings and slightly modified.
